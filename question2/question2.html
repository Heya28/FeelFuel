  <h2>Ennui and Mood-Boosting Foods</h2>
<p>
    Why did the neuron break up with the taste bud? 
    Because it was feeling mildly ennui and needed a little dopamine boost from a more exciting relationship. 
    So, it went for some chocolate, hoping to activate a better mood with a serious "receptor-ship"!
</p>
<p>
    To boost excitement, focus on foods that activate mood-enhancing receptors:
    <ul>
        <li>Dark chocolate for dopamine (D1/D2)</li>
        <li>Turkey for serotonin (5-HT1A)</li>
        <li>Chili peppers for endorphins (µ-opioid)</li>
        <li>Avocado for endocannabinoids (CB1)</li>
    </ul>
    Try a spicy turkey chili for a mood-boosting, receptor-activating meal!
</p>
<p>
    Spicy foods, especially those with capsaicin (the compound that makes chili peppers hot), can trigger a release of endorphins in the brain. 
    Endorphins are natural "feel-good" chemicals that reduce pain and increase feelings of euphoria, which is often referred to as a "runner’s high."
